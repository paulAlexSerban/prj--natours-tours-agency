#### Think - Build - Architect Mindset
##### Think
**Think** about the layout of your webpage or web app before writing code.
**Component-Driven Design**
- **Modular building blocks** that make up interfaces
- Held together by the **layout** of the page
- **Re-usable** across a project, and between different projects
- **Independent**, allowing us to use them anywhere on the page
> this "Component-Driven Design" is very similar to the "Atomic Design" philosophy and strategy of Brad Frost (Organisms are the corespondent of Components)
##### Build
* **Build** your layout in HTML and CSS with a consistent structure for naming classes.
**BEM**
- **B**lock **E**lement **M**odifier
- **BLOCK**: standalone component hat is meaningful on its own
- **ELEMENT**: part of a block hat has no standalone meaning
- **MODIFIER**: a different version of a block or an element
- **BEM** is easy to maintain, reusable and helps maintain a low specificity
- `block__element--modifier {} `
##### Architect
* Create a logical **architecture** for you CSS and JS with files and folders.
> there are several CSS architecture patterns like ITCSS, SMACSS, OOCSS or 7-1 Pattern
* **The 7-in-1 Pattern**
- 7 different folders for partial Sass/Less/Stylus files, ad 1 main file to import all other files into a compiled CSS stylesheet
### Web performance
* Less HTTP requests
* Less considered
* Compress code
* Use a CSS preprocessor
* Less images
* Compress images
